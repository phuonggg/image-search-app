##Implementation if I have more time:

Images are updated live as search text is entered: I couldn't quite figure out how to do this and didn't want to be stuck there with time constraint so I decided to implement the search with a Search button, so that once I've got images to display I can move on to other requirements.

Download button: didn't have enough time so decided to priorize the like/favorite image with grouped catergories functionality first

Reach feature: test, loading component
