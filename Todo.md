### `Implementation if I have more time:`

Images are updated live as search text is entered: I couldn't quite figure out how to do this and didn't want to be stuck there with time constraint so I decided to implement the search with a Search button, so that once I've got images to display I can move on to other requirements.

Favorite rendering: after like a photo, I need to manually refresh the page to see it apprear in Favorite page, I need to investigate in a way that it can render favorite images without manually reloading the page

Reach feature: test, loading component
